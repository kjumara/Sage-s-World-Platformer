# Sage's World Platformer

A game created for GameDev.TV 2025 Game Jam!

## About The Game

Step into Sage's World, a charming side-scrolling platformer where you embody Sage, a tiny plant-person. Each starfruit you collect at the end of a level sparks growth in the world around you, transforming your environment. Navigate treacherous spike traps, whirring saws, and perilous crushing hazards as you explore this ever-evolving world.
